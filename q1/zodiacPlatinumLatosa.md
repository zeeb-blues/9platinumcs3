# Requirements
Create a zodiacSectionLN.py file.  This file will contain your solutions to the requirements below:

a. Ask the user to enter a year of birth.  The baseline year 1900.
b. Validate user input that it should not be earlier than 1900.
c. If the user enters an invalid year then display an appropriate message then stop or abort the program.

Example:
Enter your birth year: 1800

Your Chinese Zodiac Sign is: Dragon (龙 / Lóng)
